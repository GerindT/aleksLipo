      <p>
        Hello!👋 <br /> My name is Aleksandro, I am 23 years old and this is the
        testimony of God's grace and love poured into my life. <br /> I was born
        in a Christian family, where I was surrounded by the gospel as a child.
        It has been a very big blessing. Although you may have been born into a
        Christian family, this does not give you salvation, you need a personal
        relationship with God and a decision that you make in your heart.
        <br /> I made this decision around the age of 12. I remember that at
        that time, even though I was small, I was going through a very
        depressive period and I couldn't find my identity. I don't remember much
        but I remember a verse that was a great impetus to return to our
        Creator.
        <br />
        1 Corinthians 10:13
        <br />
        No temptation has found you but human temptation; but God is faithful
        and he will not allow you to be tempted beyond your strength, but with
        the temptation he will also give you a way out so that you can withstand
        it.
        <br /> At that time I learned to surrender every burden to God.
        <br /> From the age of 12-14, I was bullied at school because of the
        color of my skin. At that time I did not understand why God allowed this
        situation in my life. In order not to worry my parents, I didn't tell
        them anything that was happening.
        <br /> The way I solved things was by becoming like these people. I
        started doing what they were doing. So in high school I started living a
        double life. Life in sin and life in family and church. A real
        hypocrite. I started having problems with alcohol and tobacco
        consumption, pornography, unhealthy relationships with girls. On the
        other hand, in the church I was an angel. <br />
        Regardless of the double life, there were times when the Holy Spirit
        convinced me of sin and I repented and returned. Then there were moments
        when I returned to the sinful life. But God is faithful and he has kept
        me. He never gave up on me. I would compare my life to Jonah's story. He
        tried to run away from God but God turned him back to the path and the
        plan he had for Jonah. <br />
        So was I, I was running away from God but he with his love and his
        discipline has returned me to his arms. <br /> A passage from the
        scripture that reminds me to stay on this path is Proverbs 3:1-8. <br />
        This is my prayer for myself and for all believers.
        <br /> God bless you!😁

          <br /> The classes were really fantastic. God has used them to break
          me and build me up. One of my favorite classes was the lesson from the
          book of Ecclesiastes, taught by Will Niven. I can safely say that God
          used that lesson to break my proud heart. During this week of lessons,
          my mind was constantly thinking about my previous life and how with my
          choices I had strayed from God, and in the end they were "Vanity of
          Vanities". During the end of the week and the end of the book, chapter
          12 was a heart attack. What I thought was: "I want to serve the living
          God with my whole life and I want to start right now. Because there
          will come a time when the illness, the energy, maybe even the mind
          will leave me."

          I had the opportunity to be a part of a wonderful program 6-month
          intervals (September 2022-March 2023). The Bible school program is
          designed to help you grow in knowledge and practice. As students, we
          have the opportunity to become part of a local service. One of their
          services is called Iron sharp. Iron sharp is a soccer service that
          focuses on sharing the gospel through sports (soccer). This was the
          service I was involved in. There were many beautiful moments. It's a
          pleasure to play, encourage and chat with guys who love football (like
          me). But I can say that it was very challenging for me to be faithful
          in that service. From this experience I realized that it is difficult
          to be faithful to God. Loyalty is also a daily choice.

          Thursday service – The first thing I want to say is that I was looking
          forward to this service. It was one of my favorite things about Bible
          school. Thursday's service focused on the students' worship and
          testimony. The reason it was one of my favorite times was because, I
          believe God speaks to our hearts through people, also when we share
          our lives it helps grow the community. The entire time during this
          service is student-led.
          <br /> Sunday Service – Also like the Thursday service, this service
          is student-led. It focuses on the worship and presentation of the
          teacher that will be for the following week."

          I had the opportunity to serve for 9 days in a village called Dushk in
          the city of Lushnje. For several years now in Dusk, Tobi and Mandi,
          together with their families, are trying to plant a church. They have
          a small building where they hold their meetings, such as the main
          service, the youth meeting, the children's meeting, etc. During this
          week we had the opportunity to be part of their services. It was
          fantastic to work with young people and children. Our focus was more
          on the youth. We also had the opportunity to help with practical me,
          cleaning the church area. My favorite ministry was evangelizing in
          another small village in Lushnje. Lushnja has about 80 villages in
          total and meetings are held in only 3 of them. The village we went to
          is called Zhamë. We had the opportunity to play with the village
          children and tell a story from the Bible.

          In the second semester, I had the opportunity to be in a town not far
          from Erseka, Leskovik. Leskovik is a town in the southeast of Albania,
          on the border with Greece. It is a very poor town and there is a
          church with only 1 Christian in the whole town. It is very difficult
          for him and his son to be organizing services there. In this country
          we had the opportunity to serve more with children and a little with a
          group of teenagers. While the adults were very indifferent to us. It
          seems that Leskovik has closed hearts to the gospel. But we want to
          trust God that he will break their heart and bring them closer to him.

          During the summer they have organized 3 camps, day camp for children,
          day camp for pre-youth and camp for young people. Also, during these
          two months, they have continued with other weekly services that they

          Our second-year program is for anyone who has completed a first-year
          Bible school at any Torchbearer center and wants further study,
          training and service experience in a cross-cultural setting. We like
          to compare this program to the image of a set of train tracks. One
          rail is the Word - learning, studying and discussing. The other rail
          is practical service - serving one another and going into the field.
          The path under the rails is community, serving as a solid foundation -
          experiencing together the indwelling, transforming life of Christ. It
          is here, in this intense, life-giving and life-taking community that
          spiritual formation takes place.

          the opportunity this semester to go to Greece, to the places where
          Paul's second missionary journey was recorded. The trip was for 5 days
          and we had a couple with us wonderful for guiding us through the
          places we were. The places we went to were Berea, Philippi,
          Thessaloniki, Athens, Corinth, Meteora. It was wonderful listening to
          the writing and watching it become more real. I can honestly say that
          my faith grew stronger. But my favorite thing was befriending Ben and
          Candis and deepening our friendship as a group between sophomore year.

          the opportunity to talk with a boy around the age of 16. I had the
          opportunity to talk with him for a long time and I gave him a Bible.

          During this first semester we had a task to prepare a lesson and
          present it to the year first. It was a wonderful experience. We had to
          learn the first letter of Peter. The division of the passages was done
          in this way; the passages written on several papers We threw them into
          a hat and chose a paper. I fell in love with 1 Peter 3:1-7, and it
          talks about marriage. At first I was stressed about this passage but
          God was gracious and everything went well and I got good impressions
          from the students.

        Përshendetje!👋 <br /> Unë quhem Aleksandro,jam 23 vjec dhe kjo është
        dëshmia e hirit dhe dashuris së Perendise e derdhur në jetën time.
        <br /> Unë kam lindur në një famlje të krishter,ku dhe jam rrethuar nga
        ungjilli që bebe. Ka qenë një bekim shumë i madh. Pavarsisht se ti mund
        të kesh lindur në një familje të krishter nuk të jep kjo shpëtim, duhet
        një mardhënie personale me Perëndin dhe një vendim që ti merr vet në
        zemrën tënde. <br /> Këte vendim unë e kam marrë rreth moshës 12 vjec.
        Mbaj mend që në atë kohë edhe pse I vogël po kaloja një periudh mjaft
        depresionuese si dhe nuk po gjeja dot identitetin. Nuk mbaj mend shumë
        por mbaj mend një varg që ka qenë shtysë e madhe për tu rikthyer tek
        Krijuesi yne. <br /> 1 Korintasve 10:13 <br />
        Asnjë tundim nuk ju ka gjetur juve, përveçse tundimi njerëzor; por
        Perëndia është besnik dhe nuk do të lejojë që t'ju tundojnë përtej
        fuqive tuaja, por me tundimin do t'ju japë dhe rrugë dalje, që ju të
        mund ta përballoni. <br />
        Në atë kohë mësova t’ja dorëzoj cdo barrë Perëndis. <br />
        Nga mosha 12-14, në shkollë jam bullizuar për shkak të ngjyrës së
        lëkurës. Në atë kohë s'e kuptoja pse Perëndia e lejonte këtë situatë në
        jetën time. Në mënyrë që mos t’i sillja shqetësime prindërve unë nuk I
        tregoja asgjë cfarë ndodhte. <br /> Mënyra si unë i zgjidha gjërat ishte
        duke u bërë si këta persona. Fillova të bëja ato c’ka bënin ata. Kështu
        në gjimnaz fillova të jetoj një jetë të dyfishtë. Jeta në mëkat dhe jeta
        në familje dhe kishë. Një hipokrit I vërtet. Fillova të kisha probleme
        me konsumimin e alkolit dhe duhanit, pornografin, mardhenien jo të
        shëndetshme me vajzat. Nga ana tjetër në kishë isha një ëngjëll. <br />
        Pavarsisht jetës së dyfisht ka pasur kohë që Fryma e Shenjtë më bindte
        për mëkat dhe pendohesha dhe kthehesha. Pastaj ka patur momente ku
        rikthehesha tek jeta mëkatare. Por Perëndia është besnik dhe ai më ka
        mbajtur. Ai nuk hoqi kurrë dorë nga unë. Jetën time do ta krahasoja me
        historin e Jonës. Ai u përpoq të largohej nga Perëndia por Zoti e ktheu
        në rrugën dhe planin që ai kishte për Jonën. <br />
        Kështu isha dhe unë, vrapoja larg Perëndis por ai me dashurinë dhe
        thuprën e tij më ka kthyer në krahët e tij. <br />
        Një pasazh nga shkrimi që më rikujton të qëndroj në këtë udhë është
        Fjalët e urta 3:1-8. <br />
        Kjo është lutja ime për veten dhe për të gjithë besimtarët. <br />
        Zoti t’ju bekojë!😁

          <br /> Klasat ishin vërtet fantastike. Perëndia i ka përdorur ato për
          të më thyer dhe ndërtuar. Një nga klasat e mia të preferuara ishte
          mësimi nga libri i Predikuesit, me mësues Ëill Niven. Mund të them me
          siguri që Zoti përdori atë mësim për të thyer zemrën time krenare.
          Gjatë kësaj jave mesimesh, mendja ime mendonte vazhdimisht për jetën
          time të mëparshme dhe se si me zgjedhjet e mia isha larguar nga
          Perëndia, dhe në fund ato ishin ”Kotësi të Kotësive”. Gjatë fundit të
          javës dhe fundit të librit, kapitulli 12 ishte një goditje e fotë në
          zemer. Ajo që mendova ishte: “Unë dua t’i shërbej me gjithë jetën time
          Perëndis së gjallë dhe dua ta nis që tani. Sepse do vi një kohë kur
          sëmundja,energjit ndoshta dhe mendja do më lën.”

          Kam patur mundësin të jem pjesë e një programi të mrekullueshëm
          përgjat 6-muajsh (shtator 2022-mars 2023). Programi i shkollës biblike
          është I ndërtuar për të ndihmuar ne rritjen në njohuri dhe në
          praktikë. Ne si student kemi mundësin të bëhemi pjesë e një shërbese
          lokale. Një nga shërbesat e tyre quhet Iron sharp. Iron sharp është
          një shërbes fotbolli që ka në qendër ndarjen e ungjillit nëpërmjet
          sportit (fotbollit). Kjo ishte shërbesa që unë u përfshiva. Ka patur
          shumë momente të bukura. Është kënaqësi të luash, të inkurajosh dhe te
          bisedosh me djem që e duan futbollin (si unë). Por mund të them që për
          mua ishte shumë sfiduese për të qen besnik në atë shërbes. Nga kjo
          eksperienc kam kuptuar që është e vështirë të jesh besnik ndaj
          Perëndis. Gjithashtu besnikëria është një zgjedhjë e përditshme.

          preferuara ishte sepse, uë besoj që Perëndia I flet zemrave tona
          nëpërmjet njerëzve, gjithashtu kur ne ndajmë nga jeta jonë ndihmon në

          dhe Mandi,bashkë me familjet e tyre, po mundohen të mbjellin një

          Ishte fantastike te punoje me të rinjt dhe fëmijët. Fokusi jonë ishte
          më shumë tek të rinjtë. Patëm gjithashtu mundësi të ndihmonim me punë

          ishte ungjillizimi në një fshat tjetër të vogël në Lushnje. Lushnja ka

          Në simestrin e dytë, kisha mundësin të isha në një qytezë jo larg

          duke shërbyer më shumë me fëmijët dhe pak me një grup adoleshentësh.
          Ndërsa të rriturit ishin shumë indiferentë ndaj nesh. Duket sikur
          Leskoviku ka zemra të mbyllura për ungjillin. Por duam ti besojmë

          dëshiron studim të mëtejshëm, trajnim dhe përvojë shërbimi në një
          mjedis ndërkulturor. Ne na pëlqen ta krahasojmë këtë program me
          imazhin e një grupi binarësh treni. Një hekurudhë është Fjala - të
          mësuarit, të studiuarit dhe të diskutuarit. Hekurudha tjetër është
          shërbimi praktik - duke i shërbyer njëri-tjetrit dhe duke shkuar në
          terren. Shtegu nën shina është komuniteti, duke shërbyer si një themel
          i fortë - duke përjetuar së bashku jetën e banuar, transformuese të
          Krishtit. Pikërisht këtu, në këtë bashkësi intensive, jetëdhënëse dhe
          jetëmarrëse ndodh formimi shpirtëror.

          Pjesë e programit të vitit të dytë janë dy udhëtime në vende
          arkeologjike biblike. Ku kemi mundësin të shohim dhe prekim vende ku
          historia provon që Shkrimet janë të vërteta. Kishim mundësi këtë
          simestër të shkonim në Greqi, në vendet ku është rregjistruar udhëtimi
          I dytë misionarë i Palit. Udhëtimi ishte për 5 ditë dhe sëbashku me ne
          kishim një ciftë të mrekullueshëm që na udhëhoqën përmes vendeve ku
          ishim. Vendet që ne shkuam, ishin Berea, Filipi,Thesaloniki,Athina,
          Korinth, Meteora. Ishte e mrekullueshme teksa dëgjoje shkrimin dhe
          shikoje se si ai bëhej më real. Mund të the me plot gojën qe besimi im
          u forcua më shumë. Por gjëja e preferuar për mua ishte miqesia me Ben
          dhe Candis dhe thellimi i shoqirisë si grup midis vitit të dytë.

          Pas Greqisë kishim në program një javë misioni. Ku kemi patur mndësi
          të shkojmë ne fshtra përreth Ersekes për të dhën mësim në anglisht në
          shkollat e fshatit dhe me pas te bënim një program pas mësimit për
          fëmijët ku dhe kemi ndarë ungjillin. Në të gjithë fshatrat jemi pritur
          mirë dhe cdo gjë shkojë mirë. Ishte vërtet fantastike të shihje se si
          Zoti na ka përdorur atë javë edhe pse nuk isha gati. Kemi pasur shumë
          momente të bukura por një nga me të bukurit për mua ishte kur pata
          mundesi të flisja me një djalë rreth moshës 16 vjec. Kisha mundësin të
          flisja gjatë me të dhe i dhurova një bibël. Ai sapo e mori nisi ta
          lexoj aty dhe ne lexuam pak sëbashku.

          Gjatë ktij simestri të parë kishim një detyrë për të përgatitur një
          mësim dhe ta prezantonim vitit të parë. Ishte një eksperienc e
          mrekullueshme. Ne kishim për të mësuar letren e parë të Pjetrit.
          Ndarja e pasazheve u bë në këtë mënyrë; pasazhet e shkruara në disa
          letra I hodhëm në një kapele dhe zgjodhëm një lëtër. Mua më ra 1
          Pjetri 3:1-7, dhe flet per martesën. Në fillim isha I stresuar për
          këtë pasazh por Zoti ishte I hirshem dhe cdo gjë shkojë mirë dhe mora
          përshtypje të mira nga studentët.
