    Text: " Hello!👋My name is Aleksandro, I am 23 years old and this is the testimony of God's grace and love poured into my life.",
    Content: (
      <p>
        Hello!👋 <br /> My name is Alexandro. I was born in the year 2000 and
        this is the testimony of God's grace and love poured into my life.
        <br /> I was born in a Christian family, where I was surrounded by the
        gospel as a baby. It has been a great blessing. Despite the fact that
        you may have been born into a Christian family, this does not give you
        salvation, you need a personal relationship with God and a decision that
        you make in your heart.
        <br /> I made this decision around the age of 12. I remember that at
        that time, even though I was young, I was going through quite a
        depressive period, and I couldn't find my identity. I don't remember
        much, but I do remember one verse that was a great impetus to return to
        our Creator.
        <br />
        1 Corinthians 10:13
        <br />
        No temptation has found you but human temptation; but God is faithful
        and will not allow you to be tempted beyond your strength, but with the
        temptation will also give you a way out, so that you can withstand it.
        <br /> At that time I learned to surrender every burden to God.
        <br /> From the age of 12-14, I was bullied at school because of the
        color of my skin. At that time I did not understand why God allowed this
        situation in my life. In order not to worry my parents, I didn't tell
        them anything about what was happening.
        <br /> The way I solved things was by becoming like these people. I
        started doing what they were doing. So, in high school I started living
        a double life. Life in sin and life in the family and church. A real
        hypocrite. I started having problems with alcohol and tobacco
        consumption, pornography, unhealthy relationships with girls. On the
        other hand, in church I was an angel. <br /> Despite the double life,
        there were times when the Holy Spirit convinced me of sin and I repented
        and returned. Then there were moments when I returned to sinful life.
        But God is faithful and He has kept me. He never gave up on me. I would
        compare my life to the story of Jonah. He tried to turn away from God,
        but God brought him back to the path and plan He had for Jonah from the
        beginning.
        <br />
        That's how I was, I was running away from God, but He with His love and
        twig has returned me to His arms. <br /> A passage of Scripture that
        reminds me to stay on this path is from <b> Proverbs 3:1-8 </b> <br />
        "My son, do not forget my teachings and let your heart keep my
        commandments, because long days, years of life and peace will be added
        to you. May goodness and truth never fail you; tie around your neck,
        write on the tablet of your heart; you will thus find grace and reason
        in the eyes of God and men. Trust in God with all your heart and lean
        not on your own judgment; acknowledge Him in all your ways, and He will
        direct your paths. Do not keep yourself in your own eyes, fear the Lord
        and turn away from evil; it will be healing to your nerves and
        refreshment to your bones.”
        <br />
        This is my prayer for myself and for all believers.
        <br /> God bless you!😁

          This is how I would describe my first year of Bible school: "God broke

          <br /> The classes were really fantastic. God has used them to break
          me and build me up. One of my favorite classes was the lesson from the
          book of Ecclesiastes, taught by Will Niven. I can safely say that God
          used that lesson to break my proud heart. During this week of lessons,
          I constantly thought about my previous life and how with my choices I
          had strayed from God, and in the end they were "Vanities of vanities".
          During the end of the week and the end of the book, chapter 12 was a
          heartbreaker. What I thought was: "I want to serve the living God with
          my whole life and I want to start right now. Because there will come a
          time when illness, energies, maybe, and mind will allow me."

          I had the opportunity to be a part of an amazing 6-month program
          (September 2022 - March 2023). The Bible school program is designed to
          help you grow in knowledge and practice. As students, we have the
          opportunity to become part of a local ministry. One of their
          ministries is called Iron sharp. Iron sharp is a soccer ministry that
          focuses on sharing the gospel through sports (soccer). This was the
          ministry I was involved in. There were many beautiful moments. It's
          fun to play, encourage and chat with guys who love football (like me).
          But I can say that it was very challenging for me to be faithful in
          that ministry. From this experience I have understood that it is
          difficult to be faithful to God. Loyalty is also a daily choice.

          Thursday Service – The first thing I want to say is, I was looking
          forward to this service. It was one of my favorite things about Bible
          school. Thursday's service focused on students' worship and testimony.
          The reason it was one of my favorite times was because, I believe that
          God speaks to our hearts through people, also, when we share our
          lives, it helps grow the community. The entire time during this
          service is student-led.
          <br /> Sunday Service – Also like the Thursday service, this service
          is student-led. It focuses on the worship and presentation of the
          teacher that will be for the following week.

          The school has 1 week of mission for each semester. Students are
          divided into small groups and sent to local churches around Albania or
          abroad. For many students these weeks are their favorite. It has also
          been a wonderful week for me, where God has been teaching me many

          I had the opportunity to serve for 9 days in a village called Dushk,
          in the city of Lushnje. For several years, now in Dushk, Tobi and
          Mandi, together with their families, are trying to plant a church.
          They have a small building where they are holding their meetings, such
          as: main service, youth meeting, children's meeting, etc. During this
          week we had the opportunity to be part of their services. It was
          fantastic to work with young people and children. Our focus was more
          on the youth. We also had the opportunity to help with practical work,
          cleaning the church premises. My favorite ministry was evangelizing in
          another small village in Lushnje. Lushnja has about 80 villages in
          total and meetings are held in only 3 of them. The village we went to
          is called Zhamë. We had the opportunity to play with the village
          children and tell a story from the Bible.

          In the second semester, I had the opportunity to be in a town not far
          from Erseka, Leskovik. Leskovik is a town in the southeast of Albania,
          on the border with Greece. It is a very poor town and there is a
          church with only 1 Christian in the whole town. It is very difficult
          for him and his son to be organizing services there. In this country
          we had the opportunity to serve more with children and a little with a
          group of teenagers. While the adults were very indifferent to us. It
          seems that Leskovik has a closed heart to the gospel. But we want to
          trust God that He will break their heart and bring them closer to
          Himself.

          stable church and they are involved in many different ministries.
          During the summer they have organized 3 camps: day camp for children,
          day camp for pre-youth and camp for young people. Also during these
          two months they have continued with other weekly services that they

          meeting, children's meeting, pre-youth meeting, youth meeting, Bible

          The second-year program is for anyone who has completed a first-year
          Bible school at any Torchbearer center and wants further study,
          training, and service experience in a cross-cultural setting. We like
          to compare this program to the image of a set of train tracks. One
          rail is the Word - learning, studying and discussing. The other rail
          is practical service - serving one another and going into the field.
          The path under the rails is community, serving as a solid foundation -
          experiencing together the indwelling, transforming life of Christ. It
          is here, in this intense, life-giving and life-taking community that
          spiritual formation takes place.

          opportunity this semester to go to Greece, to the places where Paul's
          second missionary journey is recorded. The trip was for 5 days and
          along with us we had a wonderful couple who guided us through the
          places we were. The places we went were: Berea, Philippi,
          Thessaloniki, Athens, Corinth, Meteora. It was wonderful listening to
          the writing and watching it become more real. I can honestly say that,
          my faith was strengthened more. But the favorite thing for me was the
          friendship with Ben and Candis and deepening the camaraderie as a
          group between sophomore year.

          the opportunity to talk to a boy about 16 years old. I had the

          During this first semester we had a task to prepare a lesson and
          present it to the first year. It was a wonderful experience. We were
          to learn the first letter of Peter. The division of the passages was
          done in this way; we threw the passages written on several papers into
          a hat and chose one. I came across 1 Peter 3:1-7, and it talks about
          marriage. At first I was stressed about this passage, but God was
          gracious and everything went well and I got good feedback from the
          students.

        Përshendetje!👋 <br /> Unë quhem Aleksandro. Kam lindur në vitin 2000
        dhe kjo është dëshmia e hirit dhe dashurisë së Perëndisë e derdhur në
        jetën time.
        <br />
        Unë kam lindur në një famlje të krishterë, ku dhe jam rrethuar nga
        ungjilli që bebe. Ka qenë një bekim shumë i madh. Pavarësisht se ti mund
        të kesh lindur në një familje të krishterë nuk të jep kjo shpëtim, duhet
        një marrëdhënie personale me Perëndinë dhe një vendim që ti merr vet në
        zemrën tënde.
        <br /> Këte vendim unë e kam marrë rreth moshës 12 vjeç. Mbaj mend që në
        atë kohë, edhe pse i vogël, po kaloja një periudhë mjaft depresionuese,
        si dhe, nuk po gjeja dot identitetin. Nuk mbaj mend shumë, por mbaj mend
        një varg që ka qenë shtysë e madhe për tu rikthyer te Krijuesi ynë.
        <br />
        1 Korintasve 10:13
        <br />
        Asnjë tundim nuk ju ka gjetur juve, përveçse tundimi njerëzor; por
        Perëndia është besnik dhe nuk do të lejojë që t'ju tundojnë përtej
        fuqive tuaja, por me tundimin do t'ju japë dhe rrugë dalje, që ju të
        mund ta përballoni.
        <br /> Në atë kohë mësova t’ja dorëzoj çdo barrë Perëndisë.
        <br /> Nga mosha 12-14 vjeç, në shkollë jam bullizuar për shkak të
        ngjyrës së lëkurës. Në atë kohë nuk e kuptoja pse Perëndia e lejonte
        këtë situatë në jetën time. Në mënyrë që mos t’i sillja shqetësime
        prindërve unë nuk i tregoja asgjë se çfarë ndodhte.
        <br /> Mënyra si unë i zgjidha gjërat ishte duke u bërë si këta persona.
        Fillova të bëja ato ç’ka ata bënin. Kështu, në gjimnaz fillova të jetoj
        një jetë të dyfishtë. Jeta në mëkat dhe jeta në familje e kishë. Një
        hipokrit i vërtet. Fillova të kisha probleme me konsumimin e alkoolit
        dhe duhanit, pornografinë, marrëdhenie jo të shëndetshme me vajzat. Nga
        ana tjetër, në kishë isha një engjëll. <br /> Pavarësisht jetës së
        dyfishtë ka pasur kohë që Fryma e Shenjtë më bindte për mëkat dhe
        pendohesha e kthehesha. Pastaj ka patur momente ku rikthehesha te jeta
        mëkatare. Por, Perëndia është besnik dhe Ai më ka mbajtur. Ai nuk hoqi
        kurrë dorë nga unë. Jetën time do ta krahasoja me historinë e Jonës. Ai
        u përpoq të largohej nga Perëndia, por Zoti e ktheu në rrugën dhe planin
        që Ai kishte për Jonën që në fillim.
        <br />
        Kështu isha dhe unë, vrapoja larg Perëndisë, por Ai me dashurinë dhe
        thuprën e Tij më ka kthyer në krahët e Tij. <br /> Një pasazh nga
        Shkrimi që më rikujton të qëndroj në këtë udhë është nga
        <b> Fjalët e Urta 3:1-8 </b> <br />
        “Biri im, mos harro mësimet e mia dhe zemra jote le të ruajë urdhërimet
        e mia, sepse do të të shtohen ditë të gjata, vite jete dhe paqeje.
        Mirësia dhe e vërteta mos të lënçin kurrë; lidhi rreth qafës, shkruaji
        mbi tabelën e zemrës sate; do të gjesh kështu hir dhe arsye në sytë e
        Perëndisë dhe të njerëzve. Ki besim tek Zoti me gjithë zemër dhe mos u
        mbështet në gjykimin tënd; pranoje në të gjitha rrugët e tua, dhe Ai do
        të drejtojë shtigjet e tua. Mos e mbaj veten të ditur në sytë e tu, ki
        frikë nga Zoti dhe hiq dorë nga e keqja; kjo do të jetë shërim për
        nervat e tua dhe freskim për kockat e tua.”
        <br />
        Kjo është lutja ime për veten dhe për të gjithë besimtarët.
        <br /> Zoti t’ju bekojë!😁

          <br /> Klasat ishin vërtet fantastike. Perëndia i ka përdorur ato për
          të më thyer dhe ndërtuar. Një nga klasat e mia të preferuara ishte
          mësimi nga libri i Predikuesit, me mësues Will Niven. Mund të them me
          siguri që Zoti përdori atë mësim për të thyer zemrën time krenare.
          Gjatë kësaj jave mësimesh, mendoja vazhdimisht për jetën time të
          mëparshme dhe se si me zgjedhjet e mia isha larguar nga Perëndia, dhe
          në fund ato ishin ”Kotësi të Kotësive”. Gjatë fundit të javës dhe
          fundit të librit, kapitulli 12 ishte një goditje e fortë në zemër. Ajo
          që mendova ishte: “Unë dua t’i shërbej me gjithë jetën time Perëndisë
          së gjallë dhe dua ta nis që tani. Sepse do vij një kohë kur sëmundja,
          energjitë, ndoshta, dhe mendja do më lejnë.”

          Kam patur mundësinë të jem pjesë e një programi të mrekullueshëm
          përgjat 6-muajsh (sShtator 2022 - Mars 2023). Programi i shkollës
          biblike është i ndërtuar për të ndihmuar në rritjen në njohuri dhe
          praktikë. Ne si studentë kemi mundësinë të bëhemi pjesë e një shërbese
          lokale. Një nga shërbesat e tyre quhet Iron sharp. Iron sharp është
          një shërbesë futbolli që ka në qendër ndarjen e ungjillit nëpërmjet
          sportit (futbollit). Kjo ishte shërbesa që unë u përfshiva. Ka patur
          shumë momente të bukura. Është kënaqësi të luash, të inkurajosh dhe të
          bisedosh me djem që e duan futbollin (si unë). Por mund të them që për
          mua ishte shumë sfiduese për të qenë besnik në atë shërbesë. Nga kjo
          eksperiencë kam kuptuar që është e vështirë të jesh besnik ndaj
          Perëndisë. Gjithashtu besnikëria është një zgjedhje e përditshme.

          Shërbesa e të enjteve – E para gjë që dua të them është që, unë mezi
          prisja për këtë shërbesë. Ishte një nga gjërat e mia të preferuara në
          shkollën biblike. Shërbesa e së enjtes kishte në fokus adhurimin dhe
          dëshminë e studentëve. Arsyeja pse ishte një nga kohët e mia të
          preferuara ishte sepse, unë besoj që Perëndia i flet zemrave tona
          nëpërmjet njerëzve, gjithashtu, kur ne ndajmë nga jeta jonë, ndihmon
          në rritjen e komunitetit. E gjithë koha gjatë kësaj shërbese është e
          drejtuar nga studentët.
          <br /> Shërbesa e se dielës – Gjithashtu si shërbesa e së enjtes, kjo

          Tobi dhe Mandi, bashkë me familjet e tyre, po mundohen të mbjellin një
          kishë. Ata kanë një godinë të vogël ku po zhvillojnë takimet e tyre,
          si: shërbesa kryesore, takimi i të rinjve, takimi i fëmijëve etj.
          Gjatë kësaj jave kemi patur mundësi të bëhemi pjesë e shërbesave të
          tyre. Ishte fantastike të punoje me të rinjtë dhe fëmijët. Fokusi jonë
          ishte më shumë te të rinjtë. Patëm gjithashtu mundësi të ndihmonim me
          punë praktike, duke pastruar ambientin e kishës. Shërbesa ime e
          preferuar ishte ungjillizimi në një fshat tjetër të vogël në Lushnje.
          Lushnja ka rreth 80 fshatra gjithsej dhe vetem në 3 prej tyre
          zhvillohen takime. Fshati ku ne shkuam quhet Zhamë. Patëm mundësinë që
          të luanim me fëmijët e fshatit dhe të tregonim një histori nga bibla.

          Në semestrin e dytë, kisha mundësin të isha në një qytezë jo larg

          aty ndodhet një kishëmbjellje me 1 të krishterë të vetëm në të gjithë
          qytezën. Është shumë e vështirë për të dhe djalin e tij që të jenë
          duke organizuar shërbesa aty. Në këtë vend kemi patur mundësi të jemi
          duke shërbyer më shumë me fëmijët dhe pak me një grup adoleshentësh.
          Ndërsa të rriturit ishin shumë indiferentë ndaj nesh. Duket sikur
          Leskoviku ka zemra të mbyllura për ungjillin. Por duam t’i besojmë

          Gjithashtu gjatë këtyre dy muajve ata kanë vazhduar dhe me shërbesat e

          takimi i grave, takimi i burrave, takimi i fëmijëve, takimi i para të
          rinjve, takimi i të rinjve, studimi i biblës, shërbesa në fshatra etj.

          Programi i vitit të dytë është për këdo që ka përfunduar një shkollë
          biblike të vitit të parë në çdo qendër të Pishtarmbajtësve dhe
          dëshiron studim të mëtejshëm, trajnim dhe përvojë shërbimi në një
          mjedis ndërkulturor. Ne na pëlqen ta krahasojmë këtë program me
          imazhin e një grupi binarësh treni. Një hekurudhë është Fjala - të
          mësuarit, të studiuarit dhe të diskutuarit. Hekurudha tjetër është
          shërbimi praktik - duke i shërbyer njëri-tjetrit dhe duke shkuar në
          terren. Shtegu nën shina është komuniteti, duke shërbyer si një themel
          i fortë - duke përjetuar së bashku jetën e banuar, transformuese të
          Krishtit. Pikërisht këtu, në këtë bashkësi intensive, jetëdhënëse dhe
          jetëmarrëse ndodh formimi shpirtëror.

          Pjesë e programit të vitit të dytë janë dy udhëtime në vende
          arkeologjike biblike. Ku kemi mundësinë të shohim dhe prekim vende ku
          historia provon që Shkrimet janë të vërteta. Kishim mundësi këtë
          semestër të shkonim në Greqi, në vendet ku është regjistruar udhëtimi
          i dytë misionarë i Palit. Udhëtimi ishte për 5 ditë dhe së bashku me
          ne kishim një çift të mrekullueshëm që na udhëhoqën përmes vendeve ku
          ishim. Vendet që ne shkuam ishin: Berea, Filipi, Thesalonik, Athinë,
          Korinth, Meteora. Ishte e mrekullueshme teksa dëgjoje shkrimin dhe
          shikoje se si ai bëhej më real. Mund të them me plot gojë, që, besimi
          im u forcua më shumë. Por gjëja e preferuar për mua ishte miqesia me
          Ben dhe Candis dhe thellimi i shoqërisë si grup midis vitit të dytë.

          Pas Greqisë kishim në program një javë misioni. Kemi patur mundësi të
          shkojmë në fshatra përreth Ersekës për të dhënë mësim në anglisht në
          shkollat e fshatit dhe më pas të bënim një program pas mësimit për
          fëmijët ku dhe kemi ndarë ungjillin. Në të gjithë fshatrat jemi pritur
          mirë dhe çdo gjë shkojë mirë. Ishte vërtet fantastike të shihje se si
          Zoti na ka përdorur atë javë edhe pse nuk isha gati. Kemi pasur shumë
          momente të bukura por një nga me të bukurit për mua ishte kur pata
          mundësi të flisja me një djalë rreth moshës 16 vjeç. Kisha mundësinë
          të flisja gjatë me të dhe i dhurova një bibël. Ai sapo e mori nisi ta
          lexoj aty dhe ne lexuam pak së bashku.

          Gjatë këtij semestri të parë kishim një detyrë për të përgatitur një
          mësim dhe t’jua prezantonim vitit të parë. Ishte një eksperiencë e
          mrekullueshme. Ne kishim për të mësuar letrën e parë të Pjetrit.
          Ndarja e pasazheve u bë në këtë mënyrë; pasazhet e shkruara në disa
          letra i hodhëm në një kapele dhe zgjodhëm njëe. Mua më ra 1 Pjetri
          3:1-7, dhe flet për martesën. Në fillim isha i stresuar për këtë
          pasazh, por Zoti ishte i hirshëm dhe çdo gjë shkoi mirë dhe mora
          përshtypje të mira nga studentët.
