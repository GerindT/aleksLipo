    Content: (
      <p>
        Hello!👋 <br /> My name is Aleksandro, and my life is a testimony of
        God’s grace and faithful lovingkindness never letting me go. I was born
        into a Christian family in 2000, where I grew up surrounded by the
        gospel, which has been a huge blessing. Although a person may be born
        into a Christian family, that does not always mean they are saved. That
        is a decision they make in their heart, and a personal relationship is
        something they must choose to pursue. I made this decision when I was
        about 12 years old. Even though I was young, I was going through a rough
        time with a lot of depression, and I didn’t know who I was. I don’t
        remember much about this time, but I do remember a verse that really
        helped me and encouraged me to turn to Christ. It is found in 1
        Corinthians 10:13, “No temptation has overtaken you that is not common
        to man. God is faithful, and he will not let you be tempted beyond your
        ability, but with the temptation he will also provide the way of escape,
        that you may be able to endure it” (ESV). This is when I learned to
        surrender every burden and struggle to the Lord.
        <br /> From the age of 12-14 I experienced a lot of bullying at school
        because of the color of my skin. It got very bad, and I didn’t
        understand why God would allow this to happen. I didn’t tell my parents
        how bad the situation was because I didn’t want to make them worried. My
        solution to the problem was to become like my bullies. I began to bully
        others in order to not be bullied by them. This went into high school,
        where I started living a double life. I was a real hypocrite. I started
        having problems with alcohol and tobacco consumption, pornography, and
        unhealthy relationships with girls—all while I acted like an angel at
        church. There were times when the Holy Spirit convicted me of this
        double life I was living and the different sins I was pursuing, leading
        me to turn and repent. But sooner or later I would find myself back
        again, living in sin. But God is faithful and never gave up on me. He
        continued to pursue me, no matter how many times I turned away from Him.
        <br /> I could compare my life to that of Jonah, in the Bible. He tried
        and tired to run away from God, but God chased him down and put him back
        on the right path, fulfilling the purpose He had for him. That’s what
        I’ve been like for my whole life: running away from God. But God, with
        his loving discipline, has returned me to His arms. <br /> A passage of
        Scripture that reminds me to stay on this path is from
        <b> Proverbs 3:1-8. </b>
        This is my prayer for myself and for all believers.
        <br /> God bless you!😁

          I had the opportunity to be involved in a 6-month Bible School
          program, from September 2022 to March 2023 and it was a wonderful
          experience. The program is designed to help you grow in your
          relationship with God and your knowledge of Him, while providing
          opportunities to put what you are learning into practice. It was an
          amazing year full of laughter, tears, challenges, and mazing
          community. I am so thankful that God called me here and brought me
          close to Him.

          The classes I sat through during my time at Bible School really
          impacted me. God used them to break me down and build me back up. One
          of my favorite classes was from the book of Ecclesiastes, which was
          taught by Will Niven. God used this class to break my proud heart and
          show me how the choices I had been making had really pulled me away
          from Him. Ecclesiastes talks about everything apart from God being
          “vanity of vanities,” and by the end of the week it was like I had had
          a heart attack. All I could think was, “I want to serve the living God
          with my whole life, and I want to start right now. Because life is
          short, and there may be a time when I will not be able to serve Him
          like I can now.”

          <br />
          Each week during my time at Bible School I had the opportunity to be
          involved in a ministry called Iron Sharp. Iron Sharp is a ministry
          that shares the gospel with kids and youth through sports,
          specifically soccer. While I served within this ministry, I got to
          experience many beautiful moments. I loved chatting, encouraging, and
          playing with guys who love soccer like me. Although I loved the
          ministry, it was a challenge to remain faithful to it, and it taught
          me that it is difficult to be faithful. Loyalty is a choice you must
          make every day.

            Student Worship Services
          </span>
          <br />
          At Bible School one of my favorite things that I would look forward to
          each week was the Thursday night worship service, which was led by
          students each week. We would worship God together through song, one or
          two of the students would share their testimony, we’d have a time of
          prayer for those students, and then we would close with more worship.
          I loved this time because I really saw God speaking to my heart and my
          classmates’ hearts through other people’s stories and sharing with one
          another what God has done in their lives.
          <br /> We would also have a worship service on Sunday nights. During
          this time, we would hear from our teacher for the next week. He would
          either share his testimony, something God put on his heart, or
          something God has been teaching him recently. During this time of
          worship, the community from town and the local church would be invited
          as well, which really helped to grow relationships and build
          friendship with the youth from town.

          The Bible School program includes a week dedicated to missions, where
          students are divided into small groups and are sent out to local
          churches in Albania and neighboring countries, once in first semester
          and once in second semester. For many students these two weeks are the
          highlight of their Bible School time. I learned many things through
          both of my missions weeks, and I truly had a wonderful time.

          In November during the first semester, I had the privilege to serve
          for nine days in a village called Dushk, near the city of Lushnje. The
          missionaries who serve there with their families have been working on
          planting a church for many years. They have a small building where
          they hold weekly church services, children’s programs, youth groups,
          and other activities. During the time I got to spend in Dushk, my team
          and I were able to participate in these different outreaches. Our main
          focus was on working with the youth of the area, as well as doing
          different practical work, such as cleaning up the church and the
          church compound. We also got to do some outreach in the smaller
          villages of Lushnje—this was one of my favorite parts of the week.
          There are around 80 villages under the city of Lushnje, and only three
          of them have Christian influence working within them. We got to
          evangelize in the village of Zhamë, a strongly Muslim village. We
          really saw God working and had the opportunity to play with the
          village kids and share a Bible story with them.

          In March, during the second semester of Bible School I went with a
          team to a village called Leskovik. Leskovik is in the southern part of
          Albania, near the boarder of Greece. It is a very poor town, and in
          the whole village there is only one Christian who has been there for
          many years, trying to share the gospel and bring people to Christ. It
          is very hard for him to be there, as the town is very closed to the
          gospel. During our week of ministry there we were able to reach the
          children and a small group of youth, while the adults of the town were
          indifferent towards us. We continue to pray for the people of this
          village, that God would soften their hearts towards the gospel and
          open their eyes to their need for Him.

          a trip to Greece, to follow in the footsteps of Paul’s second
          missionary journey. The trip was five days long and we visited Berea,
          Philippi, Thessaloniki, Athens, Corinth, and Meteora. As we saw these
          places we also had a teacher teaching us, connecting the locations to
          the scriptures and drawing lessons out of those passages to apply to
          our lives. The trip was amazing, as I watched and heard the scriptures
          become more real. I also loved the trip because of the community and
          friendships that grew within the 2nd year student group.

          in the local schools, then invited the kids to an afterschool program
          where we played games, shared Bible stories, and did crafts. We were
          welcomed very well in all the villages, and it was really cool to see
          how God used us during the week even though I wasn’t ready for it!
          There were many moments I saw God’s hand at work, but one in
          particular was a conversation I got to have with a boy who was about
          16 years old. I talked to him for a long time and by the end of the

          As 2nd years we also spend the whole first semester studying a book of
          the Bible together, preparing for the last week of the semester where
          we teach that book to the 1st year students. We were told we would be
          teaching on the book of 1 Peter. It was split into different sections
          and written on pieces of paper, which were then put in a hat and each
          of us took one out. Whichever passage we pulled out would be our
          responsibility to share with the 1st years in a 40-minute class. I got
          1 Peter 3:1-7, a passage on marriage. At first I was stressed about
          having this passage, but after an entire semester of studying and
          preparation, God provided me with everything to say, and, by His
          grace, everything went well and I got a good response from the other
          students.

        Përshendetje!👋 <br /> Unë quhem Aleksandro. Kam lindur në vitin 2000
        dhe kjo është dëshmia e hirit dhe dashurisë së Perëndisë e derdhur në
        jetën time.
        <br />
        Unë kam lindur në një famlje të krishterë, ku dhe jam rrethuar nga
        ungjilli që bebe. Ka qenë një bekim shumë i madh. Pavarësisht se ti mund
        të kesh lindur në një familje të krishterë nuk të jep kjo shpëtim, duhet
        një marrëdhënie personale me Perëndinë dhe një vendim që ti merr vet në
        zemrën tënde.
        <br /> Këte vendim unë e kam marrë rreth moshës 12 vjeç. Mbaj mend që në
        atë kohë, edhe pse i vogël, po kaloja një periudhë mjaft depresionuese,
        si dhe, nuk po gjeja dot identitetin. Nuk mbaj mend shumë, por mbaj mend
        një varg që ka qenë shtysë e madhe për tu rikthyer te Krijuesi ynë.
        <br />
        1 Korintasve 10:13
        <br />
        Asnjë tundim nuk ju ka gjetur juve, përveçse tundimi njerëzor; por
        Perëndia është besnik dhe nuk do të lejojë që t'ju tundojnë përtej
        fuqive tuaja, por me tundimin do t'ju japë dhe rrugë dalje, që ju të
        mund ta përballoni.
        <br /> Në atë kohë mësova t’ja dorëzoj çdo barrë Perëndisë.
        <br /> Nga mosha 12-14 vjeç, në shkollë jam bullizuar për shkak të
        ngjyrës së lëkurës. Në atë kohë nuk e kuptoja pse Perëndia e lejonte
        këtë situatë në jetën time. Në mënyrë që mos t’i sillja shqetësime
        prindërve unë nuk i tregoja asgjë se çfarë ndodhte.
        <br /> Mënyra si unë i zgjidha gjërat ishte duke u bërë si këta persona.
        Fillova të bëja ato ç’ka ata bënin. Kështu, në gjimnaz fillova të jetoj
        një jetë të dyfishtë. Jeta në mëkat dhe jeta në familje e kishë. Një
        hipokrit i vërtet. Fillova të kisha probleme me konsumimin e alkoolit
        dhe duhanit, pornografinë, marrëdhenie jo të shëndetshme me vajzat. Nga
        ana tjetër, në kishë isha një engjëll. <br /> Pavarësisht jetës së
        dyfishtë ka pasur kohë që Fryma e Shenjtë më bindte për mëkat dhe
        pendohesha e kthehesha. Pastaj ka patur momente ku rikthehesha te jeta
        mëkatare. Por, Perëndia është besnik dhe Ai më ka mbajtur. Ai nuk hoqi
        kurrë dorë nga unë. Jetën time do ta krahasoja me historinë e Jonës. Ai
        u përpoq të largohej nga Perëndia, por Zoti e ktheu në rrugën dhe planin
        që Ai kishte për Jonën që në fillim.
        <br />
        Kështu isha dhe unë, vrapoja larg Perëndisë, por Ai me dashurinë dhe
        thuprën e Tij më ka kthyer në krahët e Tij. <br /> Një pasazh nga
        Shkrimi që më rikujton të qëndroj në këtë udhë është nga
        <b> Fjalët e Urta 3:1-8 </b> <br />
        “Biri im, mos harro mësimet e mia dhe zemra jote le të ruajë urdhërimet
        e mia, sepse do të të shtohen ditë të gjata, vite jete dhe paqeje.
        Mirësia dhe e vërteta mos të lënçin kurrë; lidhi rreth qafës, shkruaji
        mbi tabelën e zemrës sate; do të gjesh kështu hir dhe arsye në sytë e
        Perëndisë dhe të njerëzve. Ki besim tek Zoti me gjithë zemër dhe mos u
        mbështet në gjykimin tënd; pranoje në të gjitha rrugët e tua, dhe Ai do
        të drejtojë shtigjet e tua. Mos e mbaj veten të ditur në sytë e tu, ki
        frikë nga Zoti dhe hiq dorë nga e keqja; kjo do të jetë shërim për
        nervat e tua dhe freskim për kockat e tua.”
        <br />
        Kjo është lutja ime për veten dhe për të gjithë besimtarët.
        <br /> Zoti t’ju bekojë!😁

          <br /> Klasat ishin vërtet fantastike. Perëndia i ka përdorur ato për
          të më thyer dhe ndërtuar. Një nga klasat e mia të preferuara ishte
          mësimi nga libri i Predikuesit, me mësues Will Niven. Mund të them me
          siguri që Zoti përdori atë mësim për të thyer zemrën time krenare.
          Gjatë kësaj jave mësimesh, mendoja vazhdimisht për jetën time të
          mëparshme dhe se si me zgjedhjet e mia isha larguar nga Perëndia, dhe
          në fund ato ishin ”Kotësi të Kotësive”. Gjatë fundit të javës dhe
          fundit të librit, kapitulli 12 ishte një goditje e fortë në zemër. Ajo
          që mendova ishte: “Unë dua t’i shërbej me gjithë jetën time Perëndisë
          së gjallë dhe dua ta nis që tani. Sepse do vij një kohë kur sëmundja,

          përgjat 6-muajsh (sShtator 2022 - Mars 2023). Programi i shkollës
          biblike është i ndërtuar për të ndihmuar në rritjen në njohuri dhe
          praktikë. Ne si studentë kemi mundësinë të bëhemi pjesë e një shërbese
          lokale. Një nga shërbesat e tyre quhet Iron sharp. Iron sharp është
          një shërbesë futbolli që ka në qendër ndarjen e ungjillit nëpërmjet
          sportit (futbollit). Kjo ishte shërbesa që unë u përfshiva. Ka patur
          shumë momente të bukura. Është kënaqësi të luash, të inkurajosh dhe të
          bisedosh me djem që e duan futbollin (si unë). Por mund të them që për
          mua ishte shumë sfiduese për të qenë besnik në atë shërbesë. Nga kjo
          eksperiencë kam kuptuar që është e vështirë të jesh besnik ndaj
          Perëndisë. Gjithashtu besnikëria është një zgjedhje e përditshme.

          dëshminë e studentëve. Arsyeja pse ishte një nga kohët e mia të
          preferuara ishte sepse, unë besoj që Perëndia i flet zemrave tona
          nëpërmjet njerëzve, gjithashtu, kur ne ndajmë nga jeta jonë, ndihmon
          në rritjen e komunitetit. E gjithë koha gjatë kësaj shërbese është e

          Gjatë kësaj jave kemi patur mundësi të bëhemi pjesë e shërbesave të

          punë praktike, duke pastruar ambientin e kishës. Shërbesa ime e

          Lushnja ka rreth 80 fshatra gjithsej dhe vetem në 3 prej tyre
          zhvillohen takime. Fshati ku ne shkuam quhet Zhamë. Patëm mundësinë që

          rinjve, takimi i të rinjve, studimi i biblës, shërbesa në fshatra etj.
          Ka qenë një kohë e mrekullueshme për mua. Jam falenderues Zotit për
          këtë mundësi që kisha për t’i shërbyer Atij. <br />

          Programi i vitit të dytë është për këdo që ka përfunduar një shkollë
          biblike të vitit të parë në çdo qendër të Pishtarmbajtësve dhe
          dëshiron studim të mëtejshëm, trajnim dhe përvojë shërbimi në një
          mjedis ndërkulturor. Ne na pëlqen ta krahasojmë këtë program me
          imazhin e një grupi binarësh treni. Një hekurudhë është Fjala - të
          mësuarit, të studiuarit dhe të diskutuarit. Hekurudha tjetër është
          shërbimi praktik - duke i shërbyer njëri-tjetrit dhe duke shkuar në
          terren. Shtegu nën shina është komuniteti, duke shërbyer si një themel
          i fortë - duke përjetuar së bashku jetën e banuar, transformuese të
          Krishtit. Pikërisht këtu, në këtë bashkësi intensive, jetëdhënëse dhe
          jetëmarrëse ndodh formimi shpirtëror.

          Pjesë e programit të vitit të dytë janë dy udhëtime në vende
          arkeologjike biblike. Ku kemi mundësinë të shohim dhe prekim vende ku
          historia provon që Shkrimet janë të vërteta. Kishim mundësi këtë
          semestër të shkonim në Greqi, në vendet ku është regjistruar udhëtimi
          i dytë misionarë i Palit. Udhëtimi ishte për 5 ditë dhe së bashku me
          ne kishim një çift të mrekullueshëm që na udhëhoqën përmes vendeve ku
          ishim. Vendet që ne shkuam ishin: Berea, Filipi, Thesalonik, Athinë,
          Korinth, Meteora. Ishte e mrekullueshme teksa dëgjoje shkrimin dhe
          shikoje se si ai bëhej më real. Mund të them me plot gojë, që, besimi
          im u forcua më shumë. Por gjëja e preferuar për mua ishte miqesia me
          Ben dhe Candis dhe thellimi i shoqërisë si grup midis vitit të dytë.

          Pas Greqisë kishim në program një javë misioni. Kemi patur mundësi të
          shkojmë në fshatra përreth Ersekës për të dhënë mësim në anglisht në
          shkollat e fshatit dhe më pas të bënim një program pas mësimit për
          fëmijët ku dhe kemi ndarë ungjillin. Në të gjithë fshatrat jemi pritur
          mirë dhe çdo gjë shkojë mirë. Ishte vërtet fantastike të shihje se si
          Zoti na ka përdorur atë javë edhe pse nuk isha gati. Kemi pasur shumë
          momente të bukura por një nga me të bukurit për mua ishte kur pata
          mundësi të flisja me një djalë rreth moshës 16 vjeç. Kisha mundësinë
          të flisja gjatë me të dhe i dhurova një bibël. Ai sapo e mori nisi ta
          lexoj aty dhe ne lexuam pak së bashku.

          Gjatë këtij semestri të parë kishim një detyrë për të përgatitur një
          mësim dhe t’jua prezantonim vitit të parë. Ishte një eksperiencë e
          mrekullueshme. Ne kishim për të mësuar letrën e parë të Pjetrit.
          Ndarja e pasazheve u bë në këtë mënyrë; pasazhet e shkruara në disa
          letra i hodhëm në një kapele dhe zgjodhëm njëe. Mua më ra 1 Pjetri
          3:1-7, dhe flet për martesën. Në fillim isha i stresuar për këtë
          pasazh, por Zoti ishte i hirshëm dhe çdo gjë shkoi mirë dhe mora
          përshtypje të mira nga studentët.
